🧐 I'm currently engaged as a Research Assistant at Northeastern University, supervised by [Prof. Yun Raymond Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/). My research interest lies in multi-modality models, specifically LLM+Vision.

🎓 I'm on track to complete my Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (MSECE) from Northeastern University by the end of Spring 2024.

🎓 My academic journey began at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and the University of Glasgow, where I pursued my undergraduate studies in Communication Engineering.
