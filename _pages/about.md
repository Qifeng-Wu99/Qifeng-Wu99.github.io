I am currently a research intern in the [Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/), [School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Min Xu](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html). I am broadly interested in **multimodal learning**, **generative AI**, and **large language models**, particularly in how different data modalities and abstract concepts within them can be effectively represented to improve generation tasks.

Before this, I pursued a MSECE degree in [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) and was fortunate to work with [Profs. Yun Raymond Fu](https://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) on developing digital avatar. My academic journey began at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and the [University of Glasgow (UoG)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), where I pursued my undergraduate studies in Communication Engineering.
