🧐 I'll join [Smilelab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/) in Northeastern University as a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Yun Raymond Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/), in spring 2024.

📚 I'm currently a MSECE student at Northeastern University

🎓 Previously, I studied communication engineering during my undergraduate years at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and University of Glasgow (UoG).
